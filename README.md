Dream FX fully automated trading

Previously, I published the source code of an application I created with the aim of fully automatic trading in FX on his GitHub.
It is a probabilistic model based on the moving average line of Rate and the moving average line of Swap, and is a technical only algorithm.
I think it is the best among tools with only technical algorithms, but if it is only technical, it cannot withstand long-term operation, so it is necessary to add more fundamental algorithms by weighting "fundamental > technical". If you go that far, you can expect high returns with fully automated trading.

If you are dreaming of fully automating your FX trading with a program, you should try using the program I created as a foundation. If you can exceed this, you can make a profit even if you dabble in fully automated FX trading.
If we can't exceed this, we won't see a day when we can make a profit. It's a waste of money and effort.
In my experience, even if you aim for fully automatic FX trading as an individual, you will never get a return commensurate with the effort.

Investment trusts from securities companies can give you high returns without much effort, so I abandoned FX and started managing my assets with investment trusts + securities-backed loans.
